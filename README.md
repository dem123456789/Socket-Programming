# Socket Programming

Socket Programming Projects involving TCP/UDP and custom TCP, RTP(Reliable Transfer Protocol)

## Introduction

1. This Project is originally from CS 3251 in Georgia Tech
2. This Project contains TCP and UDP example with python and java
3. This Project contains a custom TCP, RTP which implements flow contral, congestion control, (de)multiplexing. Add SQL and FTP server and client server with this protocol


## TCP/UDP
1. DataBase query with TCP and UDP
2. Only support one-to-one connection
2. Java version not complete due to UTF-8 implementation


## RTP
1. DataBase query with RTP over UDP
2. File Transfer with RTP over UDP
3. Support multiple clients (multiplexing) with multi-threading
4. Support simultaneous upload and download with multi-threading
5. Flow control with Selective Repeat and basic congestion control
6. Recover from out-of order, loss, and duplicate packets
7. Multiplexing and simultaneous upload and download not supported in bad channel condition


## Contributing

1. Fork
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request
